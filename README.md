# üßç Adult BMI Calculator (Java)

This is a simple Java console application that calculates the **Body Mass Index (BMI)** for adults based on height (in feet and inches) and weight (in pounds). It also classifies the result into standard BMI categories.

### üí° What It Does

The program:
- Prompts the user to enter:
  - Height in **feet** and **inches**
  - Weight in **pounds**
- Converts the total height into inches and applies the standard U.S. BMI formula:
  ```
  BMI = (weight in pounds / (height in inches)^2) √ó 703
  ```
- Determines the BMI category:
  - Underweight: BMI < 18.5
  - Healthy Weight: 18.5 ‚â§ BMI < 25
  - Overweight: 25 ‚â§ BMI < 30
  - Obesity: BMI ‚â• 30
- Displays the BMI, category, and the user‚Äôs input for reference.
